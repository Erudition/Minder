-- SHH, throughout this library we secretly we just use a Duration (which unboxes to a simple Int) under the hood, rather than an (Epoch, Duration) pair. But that's just to reduce overhead! We assume the same Epoch everywhere when storing these values, but our API does not need to know this. Oh, and the Moment should then unbox to a pure Int as well - (this is exactly how elm/time does it too, I checked) so it's just as efficient. Otherwise I would have just made Moment a type alias for Posix, which it used to be (for easy compatibility with the ecosystem).

{-| Compare a `Moment` to another, the same way you can compare integers.

Works just like a normal `compare`, returning their order in time.
If the first moment is later than the second, returns `Later`.
If the first moment is earlier than the second, returns `Earlier`.
If the moments define the same instant in time, returns `Coincident`.

{-| Compare the lateness of one `Moment` to another. Moments that come after others are later and thus will be designated `GT`, and vise versa.

Returns the the normal `Basics.Order` type, so it's handy for normal library functions like `sortWith`.

{-| As _all_ numbers in Javascript are double precision _floating point_ numbers (following the international IEEE 754 standard), that includes its internal representation of time -- yes, this means it will lose accuracy as we move into the future! (Any "integer" over 15 digits loses accuracy, so `9999999999999999 == 10000000000000000`.)

If for some reason you have one of these numbers (`Float` number of milliseconds since the UTC Epoch), this function will turn it into a Moment for you. However, it's more common to use Javascript's `new Date().getTime();`, which means you have an integer instead (in which case just use `moment (Milliseconds intHere) UTCEpoch` to get a moment, or `fromElmTime`.)

{-| Turn an Elm time (from the core `Time` library) into a Moment. If you already have the raw Int, just run `fromElmInt` on it instead.

Since 0.19 Elm has a single type for UTC time, called `Posix`. In reality "POSIX" isn't a way of telling time, it's a description of how an operating system (like Unix and GNU/Linux) should work. It does mention a standard for representing UTC (which _is_ a way of telling time), but that's already got a slightly nicer nickname ("Unix Time") and is _not_ stored as milliseconds since the epoch (like the Elm `Posix`). Rather, it counts _seconds_ since that epoch. (If sub-second accuracy is needed, it is expressed with decimal fractions.)

If you actually want a conversion from real "POSIX" time (rather than the elm type that bears the name), check out `fromUnixTime`.

{-| Turn a Unix time value into a Moment.

On "Unix-like" operating systems, the standard way of keeping time (as defined by a spec called POSIX) is with a single number of _seconds since the epoch_ as defined by the Universal Time standard (UTC) before leap second adjustments. Note that this differs from Elm's inbuilt time library (0.19+), which actually stores _milliseconds_ since the Unix/UTC epoch, despite having a type name of `Posix`. But this library can convert from this faux-Posix time too - check out `fromElmTime`.

Otherwise, use this if you have a real Unix timestamp. This library doesn't have a function named "fromPosix", so we can avoid this ambiguity. Just don't say the functionality wasn't there!

But how do Unix-like systems represent fractions of a second? With the numbers after the decimal point! Therefore, this function accepts a `Float` value. But do note that while your Gnu/Linux machine probably goes all the way down to the microsecond, the smallest Elm can handle is the millisecond - so only three decimal places of your input will be accurately recorded.

{-| How far is this Moment from a particular `Epoch`?

Note: This always gives the _correct_ answer, the actual Duration of time since the Epoch. Many systems want a supposed "number of x since y" (like Unix time) but actually deal with fake "durations" that are not really the true count of x. To get a number that describes a `Moment`, check out `toInt`. Otherwise use the appropriate conversion function such as `toUnixTime`.

{-| The famous Unix Epoch is 00:00:00 Thursday, 1 January 1970. Unix-like systems (or POSIX systems - which is a lot of the world's infrastructure!) keep time relative to this moment, by counting the number of seconds (not miliseconds, like ElmTime) since then (albeit on a discontinuous UTC timescale).

At 03:33:20 UTC on Wednesday, 18 May 2033, the Unix time value will equal 2000000000 seconds. See you at the party?

Note: For some reason, some people unfamiliar with [any epoch other](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Epoch_(computing)) than this one have misleadingly been calling Unix time "Epoch time". In reality, all timekeeping must be relative to some `Epoch`, and as you can see in this library, there's more than one possibility!

{-| Okay, so the Unix epoch is 00:00:00 Thursday, 1 January 1970. But that's UTC, and the UTC we use didn't exist until 1972! Wha??

The present form of UTC, with leap seconds, is defined only from 1 January 1972 onwards. That's why this `Epoch` is here. Prior to that, since 1 January 1961 there was an older form of UTC in which not only were there occasional time steps, which were by non-integer numbers of seconds, but also the UTC second was slightly longer than the SI second, and periodically changed to continuously approximate the Earth's rotation! Prior to 1961 there was no UTC, and prior to 1958 there was no widespread atomic timekeeping.

So, if you want your `Moment`s to always be precisely defined from system to system, use this Epoch, and you'll know that positive numbers avoid all of those problems. Any negative numbers should be understood to be an ambiguous and unspecified approximation.

{-| The moment <current-year> years ago. It's actually year 1 C.E. (common era), also called 1 A.D., not 0 A.D. (like [the video game](play0ad.com)) - and believe it or not, it directly follows year 1 B.C.E.! Why is there [no "year zero"](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Year_zero)? Because Roman Numerals had no concept of "zero", let alone a symbol for it. But hey, imagine how many `IndexOutOfBounds` errors they would have avoided!

Fun fact: More time messiness - this is only an issue in the Gregorian calendar (year zero exists in all Buddhist and Hindu calendars), but just like the issue with leap seconds can cause errors when subtracting two moments to get the distance between them, the lack of year zero causes the same problem when subtracting two years (which contain that moment in time). For this reason astronomers force 1 BCE to be "year 0", and the years before that are simply _negative_. Purity and linearity is restored! Rest assured that this is what these libraries use, when applicable. (Unfortunately, this also means those years are off by one.)

    "The year which historians call 585 B.C. is actually the year −584. The astronomical counting of the negative years is the only one suitable for arithmetical purpose." — Jean Meeus, Astronomical Algorithms

Compatibility: ISO 8601:2004 has year zero (where it again coincides with the Gregorian year 1 BC), as it now uses astronomical year numbering (and previously ISO 8601:2000, but not ISO 8601:1988). However, years prior to 1583 (when the Gregorian calendar came out) are not automatically allowed by the standard. Instead "values in the range [0000] through [1582] shall only be used by mutual agreement of the partners in information interchange."

Note that year zero (1BC) is a full year, NOT an instant in time - this epoch refers to the end of that year, or the moment year 1 CE began and 1 BCE ended.

Excel used the same date in the form of January 0, 1900 in turn to maintain compatibility with the even older Lotus 1-2-3, the IBM PC's first killer app.

Ah, legacy. While logically January 0, 1900 is equivalent to December 31, 1899, those systems did not allow users to specify the latter date. Since 1900 is incorrectly treated as a leap year in these systems, January 0, 1900 actually corresponds to the historical date of December 30, 1899.

Fun fact: Microsoft Excel also observes the fictional date of February 29, 1900 in order to maintain compatibility with older versions of Lotus 1-2-3. Lotus 1-2-3 observed the date due to an error; by the time the error was discovered, it was too late to fix it—"a change now would disrupt formulas which were written to accommodate this anomaly".

Oh, and there's another Epoch (not included) on the date December 31, 1899, used by Dyalog APL and Microsoft C/C++ 7.0 - chosen so that (date mod 7) would produce 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, 2=Tuesday, 3=Wednesday, 4=Thursday, 5=Friday, and 6=Saturday. Microsoft’s last version of non-Visual C/C++ used this, but was subsequently reverted.

{-| January 1, 1900: The epoch used by the Network Time Protocol, Mathematica, IBM CICS, RISC OS, VME, the Michigan Terminal System, and even Common Lisp!

Note: It may be tempting to think of this as "the beginning of the 20th Century", but that would actually be 1901.

Used in: LabVIEW, Apple Inc.'s classic Mac OS, JMP Scripting Language, Palm OS, MP4, Microsoft Excel (optionally), IGOR Pro

{-| The start of 1980 is the `Epoch` used by FAT32, which is probably what your flash drive is formatted to, and other older file systems: IBM BIOS INT 1Ah, DOS, OS/2, FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, exFAT. Chose because the IBM PC with its BIOS as well as 86-DOS, MS-DOS and PC DOS with their FAT12 file system were developed and introduced between 1980 and 1981.

GPS counts weeks for some reason, and a week is defined to start on Sunday, and since January 6 is the first Sunday of 1980, it is the first week.

{-| The day the Gregorian calendar begins: October 15, 1582.
It was invented by Aloysius Lilius and thus the number of days since then is called the ["Lilian Date"](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Lilian_date). So this day is Lilian Day 1.

This might also be useful for knowing when you should start considering a `Moment` in other calendars - before this date, no one actually used Gregorian!

{-| The Julian Day Number (JDN) is the integer assigned to a whole solar day in the Julian day count starting from noon Universal time, with Julian day number 0 assigned to the day starting at noon on Monday, January 1, 4713 BC, proleptic Julian calendar (November 24, 4714 BC, in the proleptic Gregorian calendar), a date at which three multi-year cycles started (which are: Indiction, Solar, and Lunar cycles) and which preceded any dates in recorded history!

Not to be confused with Dates in the Julian Calendar.

{-| A few noteworthy timescales:

  - UT0: An old Universal Time based on looking at things in the sky from labs. The biggest shortcoming is failing to account for the fact that the earth's poles move, but hey, it was early.
  - UT1: This is the principal form of "Universal Time" (ambiguous though that may be), where the idea, as in ages past, is to locate the sun and line up our timekeeping with the solar day. Except it's hard to look at the sun, so we also look at stars and satellites, too. Then we just divide that by 86,400 to figure out how long a second is, since that's how many (60\_60\_24) there are in a day. Great idea in theory, but alas, our solar day speeds up and slows down all the time!
  - UT1R: is a smoothed version of UT1, filtering out periodic variations due to tides. We didn't like how much it was changing on us...
  - UT2: is another smoothed version of UT1, filtering out periodic seasonal variations. No one uses it anymore.
  - UTC: Forget moving around with the sun, we want to pick a single length of a second and stick with it! Except we still kinda like having our solar day line up... so let's shoot ourselves in the foot and make the length of a _day_ inconsistent! Yes, UTC is finally synced to the Atomic clock, so it always ticks every SI second. But, a day is not always 84,400 seconds anymore, because at any time there could be a "leap second", all so that we can get back within a second of UT1. Yes, really. Better yet, leap seconds do not even ensure that the sun culminates exactly at 12:00:00.000, as solar noon always deviates from it (up to 16 minutes) over the course of a single year!
  - TAI: Forget all that discontinuous nonsense, for real this time! TAI is just the Atomic clock scale - a pure, linear scale of SI seconds. No leap seconds, no adjustments, no surprises - in the future nor the past. Finally some sanity! UTC is based on atomic time, and would be the same exact scale since 1958 if not for the leap seconds (10 + 27 so far; we only get 6 months' notice on future leaps, some of which may be leaps _backwards_). PTP (Precise Time Protocol) is an uber-precise (sub-microsecond!) standard for distributing time to power grids (PUP accuracy: 1 μs) and such, and it also follows TAI.
  - GMT: Greenwich Mean Time is just the old name for Universal Time, from before 1935, when the term Universal Time was recommended by the International Astronomical Union as a more precise term (because GMT could refer to either an astronomical day starting at noon, or a civil day starting at midnight). But some still use this name for civil time - better to specify UT1 or UTC.
  - GPST: The GPS Time system is 19 seconds behind TAI, and uses a pure linear scale as well - and for good reason, as just one of those leap seconds would cause a GPS location error of up to 460 meters! Currently, GPST is 18 seconds ahead of UTC.
  - TT: Terrestrial Time is exactly 32.184s ahead of TAI for any moment after 1 January 1977 00:00:32.184, when we started applying correction for gravity slowing down/speeding up time (!) based on your elevation. As you may have guessed from the name, TT is often used for talking about timing of objects in space, from the point of view of our terrestrial selves.

{-| You're working with the current time, somewhere deep in your program -- and you'd like a little pseudo-randomness. But you don't want to go through the pain of adding a new `Cmd` output and a new argument for the response as input, to every single function above the one you're in. Why not just use that `Moment` value you already have? No `Cmd`s required!

Note: This is not cryptographically secure, but neither is the `Random` library! Only use this for perceived randomness (such as, switching up the text you display to the user to keep it interesting). Don't worry, your program is still 100% reproducible!
