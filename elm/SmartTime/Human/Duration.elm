{-| A `HumanDuration` is a plain-English value for units of duration.
-}
type HumanDuration
    = Milliseconds Int
    | Seconds Int
    | Minutes Int
    | Hours Int
    | Days Int -- only fixed amount if using TAI


{-| Make your own `Duration` constant the natural human way.

Typically you only need one unit (e.g. `Minutes 5`). If however you need a more compound duration like "1min 30s" and don't feel like writing `Seconds 90`, the builder function `sum` has got your back.

-}
toDuration : HumanDuration -> Duration
toDuration humanDuration =
    case humanDuration of
        Days days ->
            scale aDay (toFloat days)

        Hours hours ->
            scale anHour (toFloat hours)

        Minutes minutes ->
            scale aMinute (toFloat minutes)

        Seconds seconds ->
            scale aSecond (toFloat seconds)

        Milliseconds milliseconds ->
            scale aMillisecond (toFloat milliseconds)


{-| Make your own `Duration` constant by combining several units.

Typically you only need one unit (e.g. `Minutes 5`), in which case you can just use that instead! If however you need a more compound duration like "1min 30s" and don't feel like writing `Seconds 90`, this builder function has got your back.

Examples:
2hr 45min == `sum [Hours 2, Minutes 45]`
17min 30sec 450ms == `sum [Minutes 17, Seconds 1, Milliseconds 450]`
5d 45min == `sum [Days 5, Minutes 45]`

This robust function can handle nonstandard possibilities that this library will never output, such as duplicate units (combine them!), out-of-order entries (it's essentially a `Set`), and values that should have been grouped into larger units. However, if you're just trying to add two durations, just use `add`!

-}
build : List HumanDuration -> Duration
build list =
    fromInt <| List.sum (List.map normalize list)


{-| Break a duration down into a human-readable list of smaller time units, skipping unit groups with a value of zero.

This will always give the smallest correct list of time units, turning 5 days and 17 minutes into `[Days 5, Minutes 17]`. However, for displaying multiple durations to users, you may find it more natural and consistent to say "5 days, 0 hours and 17 minutes".

{-| Break a duration down into a human-readable list of smaller time units, the natural way.

For consistency, the list will start with the largest nonzero unit and extend all the way down to milliseconds. If you want to ignore all zero values instead (even when between two nonzero units), try `breakdownNonzero`.

-- OUTPUT IN SINGLE TIME UNIT


{-| Express a time in terms of only one unit (the largest possible), ignoring all of the smaller units.

If an event's duration is around 4 days, for example, you probably don't care that it's actually 4 `Days`, 2 `Hours`, 30 `Minutes`, 0 `Seconds`, and 0 `Milliseconds`. This function will drop all of that and just give you `Days 4`.

On the other hand, for a film of duration 1 hour 59 minutes, you'd get `Hours 1`, which is not very accurate. So if you'd rather drop down to minutes in that case, use `inLargestExactUnits` instead.

-}
inLargestWholeUnits : Duration -> HumanDuration
inLargestWholeUnits duration =
    Maybe.withDefault (Milliseconds 0) <| List.head (breakdownNonzero duration)


{-| Express a duration in terms of only one unit (the largest possible), while keeping exact precision.

If a film's duration is exactly 2 hours, for example, you probably don't care that it's actually 0 `Days`, 2 `Hours`, 0 `Minutes`, 0 `Seconds`, 0 `Milliseconds`. This function will drop all of that and just give you `Hours 2`.

On the other hand, for a film of duration of 1 hour 30 minutes, you'd get `Minutes 90`, because that's the biggest unit that we can use without losing information. If you would rather lose info and just capture the "essence" (largest chunks) of a duration, `inLargestWholeUnits` is what you're looking for!

            Milliseconds (inMs duration)


{-| Trim the fat off a breakdown list, just like String.trim does with whitespace. Units with value 0 will be removed from the front and back of the list, but preserved if sandwiched between nonzero units.

Note: The `trim` function works like `String.trim`, which can trim the input down to nothing -- if your value is e.g. `[Days 0, Hours 0, Seconds 0]`, you'll get [], which may be formatted as an empty string. This could lead to broken UI text such as "You were in the call for ." if you do not check for it when formatting. This may be what you want, but if you'd rather fallback to a default unit, check out the variants `trimToSmall` and `trimToLarge`, or the `withDefault` function.

{-| Like `trim`, but in case all units are zero, leaves the smallest unit in the list.

This answers the question of "which unit do I leave behind?" when you try to trim a list like `[Days 0, Hours 0, Seconds 0]` without leaving the list empty. With `trimToSmall` you'd get 0 seconds, with `trimToLarge` you'd get 0 days, and with `withDefault (Hours 0)` you'd get 0 hours.
