{-| A place to store your local copy of the user's Todoist data.

By keeping this in your model, you can quickly and easily perform efficient incremental synchronization with Todoist's servers by passing it to the `sync` function! Only the (desired) resources changed since the last sync will be updated, and the commands that didn't go through will be kept around so you can retry them.

That said, this is optional. You can handle the fetched resources individually if you want, or even discard

{-| The resources you want to acquire. This is limited to the resources supported by this library, since there's no point in fetching resources and not doing anything with them. Note that currently this intentionally excudes resources that are only relevant to Todoist Premium users (e.g. `labels`, `filters`, `notes`).

(According to the API docs, the full list of supported resource types is: `labels`, `projects`, `items`, `notes`, `filters`, `reminders`, `locations`, `user`, `live_notifications`, `collaborators`, `user_settings`, `notification_settings`. However, there seems to be more (undocumented) types than that, as can be seen when syncing with "all".)

Only the Todoist response can create these values. If you don't have one, you'll have to do a `FullSync` instead (such as on the first sync).

If you get one of these, keep it! You'll use it on your next sync. Discard any older values - if you use an old value, you'll get old changes that you already knew about.
