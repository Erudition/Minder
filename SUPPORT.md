# Server-side FLO tools
- Beeper - makes various connector bridges between Matrix servers and Telegram, Whatsapp, Discord...

## Remote support
- Rustdesk is cross-platform, FLO and self-hostable
- Can't control iOS devices but it seems no proprietary option can do this either
- Might be less efficient video codec than AnyDesk but otherwise comparable
