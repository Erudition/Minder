# Main Elm Architecture
- New way to init subviews in one place only
- URL codecs for view state


# Replicator Framework
- Why do certain .set changes get ignored in tests?
- Why is parent init change not required?
- Put showstopper RON debugger in place


# Task list
- "////" in title causes slow/infinite loop - properly escape?

# Timeflow
- Take widget out of dictionary, we'll probably only need a pre-known amount
- Responsive screen sizing
